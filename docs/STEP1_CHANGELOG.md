# Step 1 change log (Contract only)

This step intentionally avoids modifying strategy logic.

## Added

- `replay/CONTRACT.md` — research/replay contract specification.
- `replay/contracts.py` — stdlib-only Python interfaces and value objects.
- `replay/__init__.py` — package marker.
- `docs/REPLAY_DISCUSSION.md` — chat discussion checklist to finalize the contract.

## Updated

- `README.md` — added a "Research & Replay (Step 1: Contract)" section to point to the contract docs.

## Unchanged

- `main.py` — unchanged.
- `risk.py` — unchanged.
- `.flake8`, `.gitignore`, `Pipfile`, `Pipfile.lock` — unchanged.
